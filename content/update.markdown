Summary: updates for 1.7 release

# 1.7 update soon!

According to Mojang's [blog](https://mojang.com/2013/10/minecraft-1-7-the-update-that-changed-the-world/), we might be able to expect a 1.7 release tomorrow, 2013-10-25.

Lots of new shit from D-bone & co:

* completely revamped world generation
* new blocks
* fishing that doesn't suck
* cool maps
* random SMP improvements
* random resource pack improvements
* chat and command improvements
* shit ton of bugfixes and other random improvements

## OK real talk:

So here's what everyone's been waiting for:

We got 9 legitimate responses to this poll, and we got a random-ass troll up in this jawn (just kidding, I'm gonna look at bringing back FTB). Five votes for a total map reset (one of which was my vote), and four votes for a reset of chunks outside of the spawn area.

Here's what's gonna go down. 

The map is going to be reset starting 1K blocks out. The beloved spawn area will be kept around, but everything past 1k blocks out will be gone. This is implying that this can be done without blowing everything up.

### Spigot

We've switched over to spigot for stability and performance reasons. Let me know if anything is janky.

### Wrapping things up

Cool beans. We've been around for over a year, which is sick. Great times, cool-ass builds, awesome people. Let's see what we can do in the next year!
